#What is Tracking Tracks?
Tracking Tracks aims to give you one search box for all major streaming music services. Check out http://trackingtracks.com for a live demo

#Why Tracking Tracks?
Are you a subscriber of one of the major music services? Have you ever encountered the dissapearance of one of your favorite songs, albums or artists? Did you check the competitor to find out they (still) had your fav tracks? That's why. To fight this annoyance. Truth be told, we haven't got a real plan so far. But we thought the first step would be to show the fact that the other service might be better for you. The next step is to make something that lets you switch from Spotify to Deezer with one click. To that we can only say one thing for now.
